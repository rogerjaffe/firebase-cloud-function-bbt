This is a cloud computing project for Computer Science 3/4 (3rd year CS). Students create an ExpressJS server configured to deploy to Firebase Cloud Functions. Google requires accounts be on the Blaze pay-as-you-go plan in order to deploy.

I created an account under rogerjaffe@mrjaffesclass.com with the Blaze plan and under the IAM menu added the user group cs34-2021-2022@mrjaffesclass.com. Student accounts who will deploy must be a member of this group. Log in to rogerjaffe@mrjaffesclass.com and go to G-Suite admin. Click Directory | Groups to add users. All CS3/4 students need to be added to this group to get permission to use the Firebase big-bang-theory-25fd5 project in the cs34.cloud.functions@mrjaffesclass.com user.

The Big Bang Theory data comes from a Github repository. Students are tasked with retrieving information from this dataset based on server routes

Students must log in with firebase login CLI command. It takes a few minutes for the group to propagate and allow the bbt project to be selected.
